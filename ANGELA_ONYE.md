My name is Angela Oluebube Onyekwelu, and I’m currently pursuing my MBA in Strategic Management and Leadership. I am passionate about technology and creative solutions, and I enjoy exploring innovative ways to improve systems and processes.

One of my favourite ways to unwind is by swimming. I love this sport because it’s both relaxing and energizing. It helps me clear my mind, stay fit, and build endurance. Being in the water gives me a sense of peace and balance, it’s my perfect way to recharge and reflect after a busy day.

When it comes to food, nothing beats Jollof rice, especially the Nigerian version! I love it because it reminds me of home, family gatherings, and celebrations. The rich, smoky flavour and vibrant colour make it a dish that always brings joy and connection.

My favourite music is “Essence” by Wizkid ft. Tems, a song that beautifully blends Afrobeat rhythm and soulful vocals. It’s my go-to track for motivation and positive energy. You can listen to it here:

An interesting fact about me is that I’m passionate about creative problem-solving. I enjoy finding innovative ways to make systems more efficient and people’s lives a little easier.
